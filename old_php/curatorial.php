    </h2>

        Sonic Acts Biennial Melted for Love explores the sounds of home. It proposes friendly methodologies of feeling (at) home, technologies of welcoming, and initiates open-ended proposals of participating in hospitality. With ‘melted for love’ as the guideline, it seeks to animate closeness and friendship, and rather than seeing strangers everywhere, it embraces the world as a mesh of souls – human and otherwise – that need to live together. If home is love – love as a network, family, friendship, kinship – this Biennial investigates and brings forth methodologies of communities that work together in solidarity, that have replaced exhaustion with tenderness.

        Attentiveness, respect, and care are expressions of love, and that is what we do when we listen carefully. Voice has always been a tool for liberation and resistance, and in moments when free speech is under threat and empty noise is everywhere around, our obligation is to keep on cultivating and initiating spaces that are open and that can serve as blueprints for new institutions. We share a feeling that we are slowly losing home when our solid grounds – our public institutions and cultures that we call home – tumble under the pressures of populism. Sonic Acts Biennial is committed to building upon a legacy of collectivism, free spirit, and experimentation, that has characterised previous editions of the festival, in investigating how radical listening and making can guide us in finding different ways of communication and togetherness.

         Methodologies of collective listening have guided this curatorial process that was composed from five distinct voices. Inspired by the verses of the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish – which echo in the Biennial title – the programme aims to provoke with various listening prompts in the times of wars, transitions, and exile such as, how can sound bring us closer to home; what is a folk song and can it be liberated; can sounds of grief be censored and what is the history of lament songs; can we learn the importance of listening from various Indigenous practices; how to rethink music legacies with previously excluded voices; what can we learn from rituals and can we stage them with sounds; how to think about radio transmission as a tool of solidarity in exile; how is sound used in warfare; what is a sound in space; what is a sound of a territory; who gets to have a voice and how does voice translate to music; how can listening together open us up to hospitality without conditions and with love.
